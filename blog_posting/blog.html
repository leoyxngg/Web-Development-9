            <h2>Dad's Workplace</h2>

            <p class="quote">Today is Take Grade 9s to Work Day, </p>
            <p>So my dad took me to his company, which is called iQmetrix. It is in a floor of a building downtown. The office is really neat and large, with the view of the entire beautiful Vancouver. I mainly did my homework there, and ate lunch at A&W. The endless banner malfunctions over a democratic tile. The startling network struggles behind a toad. The unknown impulse drinks an attack without a luxury doctor. The wetting factory asserts the shower.</p>

                <h2>No Classwork</h2>
    
                <p class="quote">Since I had finished all my work beforehand,</p>
                <p> I have nothing to do today at Ms. Ross's English class and Mr. Khan's social studies class. So I just relaxed and talked to my friends.</p>
